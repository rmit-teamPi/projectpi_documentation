The Punnet of Berries
---------------------

A Beowulf_ cluster is a collection of (typically) inexpensive computers, networked together 
by a local area network, usually an Ethernet, and running some parallel processing software. 
This concept puts the power of supercomputing into the hands of schools and small research 
groups.

Developed to educate and inspire the next generation of programmers, the Raspberry Pi is a 
single-board, credit card sized device. It is capable of running Linux, and other 
light-weight operating systems, with its ARM processors.

The Raspberry Pi is a powerful, yet, low-cost "mini-computer". The **Punnet of Berries** 
project aims to create a Raspberry Pi *Beowulf cluster*.
