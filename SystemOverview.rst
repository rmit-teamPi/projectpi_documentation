System Overview
===============

In order for a compute cluster to function properly and fairly, its resources must 
be managed and monitored by a batch system scheduler. Batch systems enforce 
limits on the number of jobs running at one time and the resources available to them. 
Compute cluster users request resources by submitting jobs to the batch system, which
then determines the scheduling that best utilises the resources available.

The Punnet of Berries compute cluster will be managed by a custom batch system, the 
*Berry Batch*.
