Zach Ryan's Log
===============

.. note::

    **Note from Alyssa:** As you can see from this project log, Zach was an extremely 
    uncooperative team member. After asking him to start his log many, many, many times, 
    it wasn't until eight weeks into the project that he finally created this empty 
    template. Obviously, he never filled it out.
