The Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer. This credit card sized device is capable of 
running Linux, and other light-weight operating systems, with its ARM processors.

A Beowulf_ cluster is a collection of (typically) inexpensive computers, networked 
together by a local area network, usually an Ethernet, and running some parallel processing 
software. This concept puts the power of supercomputing into the hands of schools and small
research groups.

Developed to educate and inspire the next generation of programmers, the Raspberry Pi is a 
powerful, yet, low-cost "mini-computer".

The **Punnet of Berries** project aims to create a *Beowulf cluster* out of several Raspberry 
Pis.
