Summary
=======
When setting out to build a Raspberry Pi computer cluster, one should never aim
to create a system capable of making the list of the Top 500 supercomputers in
the world. After all, such a cluster is no substitute for a true supercomputer.

So what's the point you ask?

While a Raspberry Pi computer cluster will never come close to a modern day 
supercomputer, it's a fantastic and fundamental representation of a full scale 
supercomputer on a budget. Sure the performance per dollar ratio will never 
even come close to that of a true supercomputer, but there's one major benefit 
to creating an RPi cluster. It's relatively affordable for anyone who would like
to build one. Traditionally supercomputers are reserved for organisations and
educational institutions who can afford them.
