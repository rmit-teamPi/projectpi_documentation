Summary
=======
When setting out to build a Raspberry Pi computer cluster, one should never aim
to create a system capable of making the list of the Top 500 supercomputers in
the world. After all, such a cluster is no substitute for a true supercomputer.

So what's the point you ask?

While the performance of a Raspberry Pi computer cluster will never come close 
to a modern day supercomputer, it's a fantastic and fundamental representation 
of a full scale supercomputer on a budget. Sure the performance per dollar ratio
will never even come close to that of a true supercomputer, but there's one 
major benefit to creating an RPi cluster. It's relatively affordable for anyone 
who would like to build one. Traditionally supercomputers have been reserved for 
organisations and educational institutions who can afford them. This means that
access to such systems is often limited and out of reach for most individuals.

With the birth and release of the Raspberry Pi onto the market, thousands of 
interesting projects were brought to life. With the cost of a single unit coming
in at approximately $35 (depending on country), the idea of a building a
distributed computing cluster on a budget was made a reality.
