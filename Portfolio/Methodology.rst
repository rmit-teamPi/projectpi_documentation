Collaboration Tools
===================
The collaboration tools utilised for the development of the Punnet of Berries project
reflect the Open Source nature of the project.

Version Control:
    All code and documentation relating to the Punnet of Berries project is hosted in
    repositories on GitHub_ under the *rmit-teamPi* organisation. GitHub was chosen as it
    allows individual team members to use either Git or SVN depending on their own preferences.

Project Management:
    The project and bug-tracking was managed using Redmine_, an open source web-based project 
    management tool. The team's Redmine account was hosted on HostedRedmine_, a service that 
    hosts standard Redmine projects for free.

Group Communication:
    Aside from weekly group meetings, our main avenues for group communication were a TeamPi 
    Facebook group and Skype chat sessions.
