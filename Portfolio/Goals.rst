Goals and Objectives
====================
The key goals of the Punnet of Berries project were to:

- Create a Beowulf compute cluster
- Develop a basic batch system scheduler
- Demonstrate scheduling concepts
- Develop descriptive documentation so that others may recreate the Punnet of Berries project

A financially viable Beowulf cluster was created as a part of the Punnet of Berries project. 
The cluster is energy efficient and demonstrates the advantages of parallel computing.

During the development of the Punnet of Berries, three key design principles were kept in mind.

- Scalability
    A computer cluster is, by nature, designed to be scalable. It was important that this 
    inherent design characteristic be adhered to in order to avoid any sort of strict node
    limitations.
- Usability
    The Punnet of Berries project is largely for educational purposes. As such, it was 
    important that the cluster be easily constructed with high cohesion. TeamPi aimed to 
    create an application interface that is readily accessible.
- Flexibility
    In order to best demonstrate scheduling concepts, the Berry Batch was created to allow
    customisation. This was achieved by offering the user different options for the main
    features of the Berry Batch.

    > Scheduling algorithm: First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Round Robin (RR) or Priority 
    scheduling.

    > I/O: Blocking or Non-Blocking.
