Goals and Objectives
====================

The Punnet of Berries project aims to create a financially viable Beowulf cluster, which 
is energy efficient and demonstrates the advantages of parallel computing. This will be 
achieved by utilising inexpensive hardware and open source technologies. In order to 
function properly, the system's resources will need to be managed and allocated by a batch 
scheduler. The Punnet of Berries will be accompanied by a custom batch system, the 
*Berry Batch*.

**Priority Objectives**

    - Establish open source tools that will be utilized.
    - Generate system topology and determine appropriate interfaces.
    - Develop system and application design.
    - Determine most appropriate software development methodology.

**Functional Requirements**

    - The user must be able to specify the number of cores to undertake any given job.
    - The Batch master must be able to support as many slave nodes as possible.

*These requirements will be expanded on throughout development.*

**Non-functional Requirements**

    - Scalability
    - Testability
    - Reliability
    - Documentation
    - Open Source
